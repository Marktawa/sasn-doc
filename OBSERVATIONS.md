Possibly write a guide on how to handle Strapi updates during the development process, production process etc

The Strapi Dashboard in mobile view has no way of accessing the Content-Type Builder. The Hamburger drop-down menu only shows "Deploy", "Settings", and "Username". The other links in the header are for "Home", "Content Manager", and "Media Library"

You can submit to Theo the tutorial together with the OBSERVATIONS.md file. A way to share your own observation
