How should I go about rewriting the section? I like to work incrementally. I start with the simplest, most barebone implementation then slowly graduate the complexity, showcasing my progress each step of the way. One feature at a time. Styling is only done after I have confirmed that the app works.

Take a look at the following text. Please list out the features that are being implemented.

I need to update the article `part3.md`. It is part of an article series. `part1_rev.md` and `part2_rev.md` are parts of the article series I have updated already.

I have decided to make some changes to the `part3.md` article update.I have decided that:
- Images will be hosted locally
- The Strapi backend will be deployed to Strapi Cloud
- THe Nuxt frontend will be deployed to Cloudflare Pages
- Styling will be done after confimring the app works and after deploying a barebones version of the app. Less code to deal with makes it easier to read

 This article is very difficlut to follow. It has long code snippets that are hard to understand and seems more like a info dump than a teaching process. I am thinking about simplifying it so that it works with current versions of Nuxt and Strapi. 

When I write articles, I don't include the functionality and styling in one go. I prefer writing about a feature in its simplest barebones state without any styling. Then test each feature to see if it works. I also don't bundle up features all at once. I like writing feature by feature taking the simplest and most minimal approach first. This helps me think. The styling is only done after I have confirmed that all the features work. 

Briefly outline to me how I can go about this?
